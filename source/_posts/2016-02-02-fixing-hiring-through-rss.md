> Really, I appreciate your attention. Both you and I know that sooner or later I'll be looking for a job again. I understand you might need to hire someone right now. In this case, and if you're not a recruiter, you could still find my email address on the web and take your chance if you really believe I would be a good fit. Otherwise, if you're not in a hurry and if you consider I would still be worth hiring in a few months/years/decades or if you think I'd be an awesome colleague, here's what you could do: Subscribe to [this RSS feed](https://vhf.github.io/job.xml) to get notified as soon as I'm back on the job market.

> Now, of course I might be stuck in an unsatisfying position and wouldn't like my boss to be aware that I'm looking for a way out, but I don't want to be pessimistic. I don't have the relevant data but I'm not sure most people in my industry switch jobs without spending a few (f)unemployed weeks looking for the best option in between.
> 
> Should you subscribe, here is my pledge to you:
> 
> * I will not use this feed if I don't need to. A publication on this feed will be a definitive signal of my intention of finding a new job. (Or a short message containing a new address for this feed if for whatever reason I need to move it.)
> * I will publish something on this RSS feed as soon as I need to.
> * It will contain a very short bio and describe what I'm looking for (in terms of position, company type/size, technology, location, part/full-time, perhaps even remuneration).
> * It will inform you of my preferred method(s) of contact (to schedule a call, ask for a full CV, etc).

<b id="f1">1</b> Although (according to [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=%2Fm%2F035c93%2C%20%2Fm%2F0n5tx&cmpt=q&tz=Etc%2FGMT-1)) interest for web feeds in the general public has been steadily declining since December 2005, more than a third of the top 1,000,000 most visited websites are providing an XML feed according to [builtwith](http://trends.builtwith.com/feeds/). Please get in touch if you have relevant data, e.g. if you know whether this &gt;33% statistic is in a down- or uptrend. We could even mine [Common Crawl](https://commoncrawl.org/) for XML feeds presence with subdomain granularity. Any help much appreciated. <a href="#a1" title="Jump back to footnote reference">â†©</a>
